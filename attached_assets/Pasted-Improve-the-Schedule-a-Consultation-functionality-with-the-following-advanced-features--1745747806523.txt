Improve the "Schedule a Consultation" functionality with the following advanced features:

---

📩 1. Customize Email Content After Booking:
- Set up a dynamic email template to send confirmation emails to users after they book.
- Email should include:
  - User's name
  - Selected service (Web Development, Branding, Social Media, Influencer)
  - Date and Time of the booking
  - Automatically generated Google Meet link
- Email content must be styled cleanly, with branding if possible.

Example email text:

Thank you for scheduling a consultation with B&B Technology!

📹 2. Automatically Generate and Insert a Google Meet Link:
- Integrate Google Calendar API (or use a calendar booking system like Calendly) to automatically create a Google Meet link for each confirmed appointment.
- After a user submits the booking form:
  - Create an event in Google Calendar.
  - Enable "Add Google Meet Video Conferencing" option.
  - Capture the generated `hangoutLink`.
  - Insert the meeting link into the confirmation email dynamically.

🕓 3. Prevent Double Booking of the Same Time Slot:
- When a user selects a date and time, check if that slot is already booked.
- If the slot is occupied:
  - Show a message like "This time is no longer available, please select another."
  - Prevent the user from completing the booking.
- Only available slots should be shown dynamically based on:
  - Booked slots from your database
  - Busy times pulled from Google Calendar (if integrated)

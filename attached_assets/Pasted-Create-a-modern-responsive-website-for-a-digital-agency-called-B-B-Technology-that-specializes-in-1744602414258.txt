Create a modern, responsive website for a digital agency called “B&B Technology” that specializes in software development, web design, influencer marketing, social media management (SMMA), and personal branding. The website should have a professional but creative look, reflecting innovation, trust, and aesthetic quality.

Use a clean and elegant color palette: navy blue (#081C3A), soft white (#F5F7FA), and accent light blue (#4BA3F2). The site should use a modern, sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Poppins) and have smooth transitions and subtle shadows to give depth.

- Left: B&B Technology logo (text or image)

Fix the scheduling system's timezone mismatch issue between the website and Google Calendar.

Apply the following improvements:

---

üïë 1. Capture User's Local Timezone:
- When a user books a consultation, automatically detect their local timezone from the browser.
- Use JavaScript to get the timezone dynamically:
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const userTimezone = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
Store this timezone value in a hidden input field inside the booking form.

Submit this timezone along with the form data.

üóìÔ∏è 2. Create Google Calendar Events with the Correct Timezone:

When creating an event via Google Calendar API:

Set the start.timeZone and end.timeZone fields to the user's detected timezone.

Do not rely only on UTC or server timezone.

Example event creation JSON:

json
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
{
  "summary": "Web Development Consultation",
  "start": {
    "dateTime": "2025-04-29T14:00:00",
    "timeZone": "{{user_timezone}}"
  },
  "end": {
    "dateTime": "2025-04-29T14:30:00",
    "timeZone": "{{user_timezone}}"
  },
  "conferenceData": {
    "createRequest": {
      "conferenceSolutionKey": {
        "type": "hangoutsMeet"
      },
      "requestId": "{{unique_id}}"
    }
  },
  "attendees": [
    {"email": "{{user_email}}"}
  ]
}
Replace {{user_timezone}} dynamically with the user's timezone captured during booking.

‚úÖ Expected Result:

If the user selects 2:00 PM local time, the event will also appear at 2:00 PM in Google Calendar.

No time offset issues (like 2PM showing as 4PM) will happen.

Automatic Google Meet link generation will continue working properly.

üé® Additional Requirements:

Keep form UX smooth and minimal.

Show a loading spinner while creating the Google Meet and Calendar event.

Confirm successful booking to the user clearly, mentioning the correct time in their local timezone.

üéØ GOAL: Ensure the consultation booking system accurately respects each user's local time, creating Google Calendar events with the correct local time and timezone, eliminating confusion and missed meetings.

Create a premium and unified background design for both the *navbar* and the *homepage hero section* of a digital agency website called *B&B Technology*.

---

üé® BACKGROUND STYLE:

- Use a smooth *linear gradient* background that feels luxurious, tech-forward, and modern
- Gradient colors:
  - Start: Deep Navy Blue #081C3A
  - End: Vibrant Sky Blue #4BA3F2
- Suggested direction:
  ‚Üí to bottom right or 135deg for diagonal movement

Example CSS:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #081C3A 0%, #4BA3F2 100%);
This background must cover:

The entire viewport of the homepage

The navbar, using backdrop-blur if desired or just sharing the same background

üí° LOGO AREA:

In the center of the hero section, place a large version of the B&B Technology logo

Add visual effects to the logo:

drop-shadow

soft glow

blurred radial light behind the logo to give depth

Example logo effect (CSS):

css
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
.logo-large {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 4px 20px rgba(75, 163, 242, 0.6));
  animation: glowPulse 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}
@keyframes glowPulse {
  0% { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 10px rgba(75, 163, 242, 0.3)); }
  50% { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 20px rgba(75, 163, 242, 0.7)); }
  100% { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 10px rgba(75, 163, 242, 0.3)); }
}
Optional enhancement:

Add a radial gradient light spot behind the logo (like Apple product reveals)

css
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08), transparent 70%);
üìê DESIGN TONE:

The overall visual should feel like:

Professional

Clean

Futuristic

Reliable

It should create a cinematic first impression, without overwhelming animations

üéØ GOAL:

Make users feel like they‚Äôve landed on a premium digital experience.
The gradient + large glowing logo should immediately build trust and show design authority.

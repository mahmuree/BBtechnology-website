Design a premium, modern, and interactive website for a high-end digital agency named *B&B Technology*. The agency offers four core services:  
- Social Media Marketing (SMMA)  
- Influencer Marketing  
- Branding  
- Web Development

The website must reflect an elite, polished, and trustworthy brand image — combining the elegance of a design agency with the technical authority of a software firm.

We will provide our *official logo* and request that it is used in a way that feels *bold, premium, and central to the brand identity* — prominently featured in the header, footer, and relevant visual areas (e.g. hero, pricing).
